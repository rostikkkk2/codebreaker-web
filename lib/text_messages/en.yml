  game_rules: "<br> Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code created by a code-maker.<br>
        The codemaker, which will be played by the application weâ€™re going to write,<br>
        creates a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6.<br>
        The codebreaker gets some number of chances to break the code (depends on chosen difficulty).<br>
        In each turn, the codebreaker makes a guess of 4 numbers.<br>
        The codemaker then marks the guess with up to 4 signs -  or - or empty spaces.  <br>
        A  indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers,<br>
        in the secret code and in the same position.<br>
        For example: <br>
        Secret number - 1234<br>
        Input number - 6264 <br>
        Number of pluses - 2 (second and fourth position)<br>
        A - indicates a number match:  <br>
        one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers,<br>
        in the secret code but in a different position.<br>
        For example:<br>
        Secret number - 1234<br>
        Input number - 6462<br>
        Number of minuses - 2 (second and fourth position)<br>
        An empty space indicates that there is not a current digit in a secret number.<br>
        If codebreaker inputs the exact number as a secret number<br>
        - codebreaker wins the game. If all attempts are spent - codebreaker loses.<br>
        Codebreaker also has some number of hints(depends on chosen difficulty).<br>
        If a user takes a hint - he receives back a separate digit of the secret code.<br> "
